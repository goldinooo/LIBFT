# LIBFT
Your first 42 Project.
# libft.h

## Overview
`libft.h` is a foundational project at 42 Coding School that involves creating a custom library in C. 
 This project focuses on various essential new programming concepts you may have seen them in the 
 month of pool so you deff got this . ðŸ˜Ž

## Key Aspects

### String Manipulation
The project includes a variety of functions to handle string operations. These functions allow for:
- String Length Calculation: Implementing `ft_strlen` to determine the length of a string.
- String Copying: Creating `ft_strcpy` to copy one string to another.
- String Concatenation: Using `ft_strcat` to concatenate two strings efficiently.
- String Comparison: Implementing `ft_strcmp` to compare two strings lexicographically.

### Typecasting
Typecasting is an important aspect of this project, where you will learn to:
- Convert between different data types safely.
- Use functions like `ft_atoi` to convert strings to integers.
- Handle character conversions with `ft_toupper` and `ft_tolower`.

### Makefile
The project requires the creation of a Makefile to automate the build process. Key components include:
- Compilation Rules: Defining how to compile the source files into object files.
- Library Creation: Instructions to create the static library `libft.a`.
- Clean Commands: Implementing commands to clean up the build directory.

## Conclusion
The `libft.h` project serves as a critical building block for mastering C programming at 42 Coding School. 
By completing this project, you will enhance your understanding of string manipulation, typecasting, and project organization through the use of Makefiles.
